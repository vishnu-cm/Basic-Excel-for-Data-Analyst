###### Excel Data Analysis Practice – README

###### 

###### Overview



This project demonstrates my Excel data analysis skills using a simulated sales dataset.

The objective is to practice data cleaning, analysis, lookup functions, PivotTables, and basic reporting, similar to real-world business scenarios.





🗂️ Files \& Sheets Description



\* Sales\_Data (Sheet 1 )



Contains transactional sales data with the following columns:



Order\_ID



Product\_ID



Region



Sales



Product\_Name (added using lookup)



Category (added using lookup)



Cost (added using lookup)



Profit (calculated field)



\* Product\_Master Sheet



Acts as a reference (master) table containing product details:



Product\_ID



Product\_Name



Category



Cost



This sheet is used to demonstrate data merging using lookup functions.



\*\* Skills \& Concepts Practiced



✅ Excel Fundamentals



Data structuring using Excel Tables



Sorting and filtering



Basic aggregation (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT)



✅ Formula \& Logic Functions



IF



AND



SUMIF, SUMIFS



COUNTIF, COUNTIFS



Used to apply business rules and conditional analysis.



✅ Lookup Functions



VLOOKUP 



XLOOKUP



Use case:



Retrieved Product Name, Category, and Cost from Product\_Master



Demonstrated handling of missing values using default return values



✅ Calculations



Profit calculation:



Profit = Sales – Cost





Identification of highest profit products



✅ Data Cleaning Techniques



Removal of duplicates



Text standardization concepts (TRIM, UPPER, LOWER – practice ready)



Error handling using lookup defaults



✅ PivotTables



Created PivotTables to analyze:



Total Sales by Region



Total Sales by Category



Profit analysis by Product and Category



PivotTables were used to quickly summarize and answer business questions.



✅ Data Visualization



Column charts for sales comparison



Clean formatting for readability



Business-focused presentation style



\*\* Business Questions Answered
